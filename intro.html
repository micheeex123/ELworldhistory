        <p> Hello everyone! Welcome to Enhance Learning's World History course and curriculum! Before we start diving deep into learning about
            history, we need to first acknowledge the importance of history as well as some study mechanisms for history! </p>

        
        <h3> Why is History Important? </h3>
        <p> History is important for a variety of reasons, one being the fact that the changes that occurred in the past allows us to analyze 
            any patterns of trends, so we can prevent any similar problems to arise. These close analyses of changes also allow us to gain a 
            fundamental understanding of why the world is what it is like today. To put into perspective, let's think about what the world would 
            be like without World War 1. It would be extremely different, right? Having a full understanding of World War 1 would give us the 
            necessary knowledge to not only prevent another situation like that from happening again, but also explain why future events occured  
            the way that they did. Speaking of cause and effect, let's move on to the various study habits to develop while studying history!</p>


        <h3> Study Habits for History</h3>
        <p>History is very different from "STEM" subjects, especially in the way you study for it. There's no formula to memorize in order to 
            succeed in your class. Instead, there are multiple ways to study, but in the end, it is up to you to decide which method works best
            for you and your class. I can say first handedly that my first history quiz humbled me quite a bit, but by implementing study habits
            that suited me and the way I studied, everything worked out well in the end! Below are some study mechanisms for you to check out!</p>

        <h4> Analyze Cause and Effects </h4>
        <h5>  Unfortunately, history is not simply just brute memorization. Though pure memorization will serve you well for a 
             while, it will not sustain your overall ability to comprehend all the information. Instead, try to understand all 
             the cause of effects of each event as well as the impact an important individual made on a community. For example,
             instead of simply knowing that World War 1 occurred from 1914 to 1918, try understanding what events <b> <u> led</b></u> to the 
             the start of World War 1 as well as the <b> <u> impact</b></u> WW1 had on future events such as the Treaty of Versailles and the 
             Russian Revolution. One way to visualize what events led to another is to make a mind map. The one attached below
             is incomplete, yet it still gives us a general idea of how these events relate to each other! <br>
             <br>
            </h5>

        <h4> Visualize the General Timeline </h4>
        <h5> It is totally not necessary to memorize each and every single date of every event you learn in world history, but it 
                is definitely helpful to understand the general timeline of events. During one of my quizzes, I was once stuck between 
                two answer choices, but I was ultimately able to get the right one because I knew what time period the question was 
                 referring to. For good practice, always keep in mind which events come before what and whether a particular person is 
                relevant in a certain time period! Never make the mistake of thinking that the Cold War came before the Enlightenment!
                <br>
            </h5>

        <h4> Understand the Context </h4>
        <h5> Context is vital to understanding a certain topic, or even a singular word! In world history, certain events are very 
                particular and unique, but keep in mind that there are quite of few Treaty of Paris treaties! In order to differntiate 
                between them, you must understand in what context each treaty is being referred to. Some questions to ask yourself in 
                understanding the context are: What caused this? Are there specific people who caused this? Why did this occur? Why is 
                it important? Can I rephrase this in my own words? The last question is mainly for YOU to really understand what you're studying!
                <br>
            </h5>

        <p> Hopefully, some of these tips will be of use for your success in world history this year! <br>
            The next chapter, Chapter 2, will go into 
            detail of the Early Modern Era! </p>
